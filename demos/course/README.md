xapi-jqm based course demo
--------------------------

This is a fully functional course that teaches a learner about the process of making french toast and quizes their knowledge. It uses [jQuery Mobile](http://www.jquerymobile.com) for layout and interactions, combined with [xAPIWrapper](https://github.com/adlnet/xAPIWrapper) to send, and retrieve data from a Learning Record Store (LRS).

The [functions.js](js/functions.js) file does all the heavy lifting by pulling values from the HTML to build statements and send them on specific events (such as page change).

You can find isolated examples for specific functionality in the demos/templates directory.

### Setup

This course was designed to run both on a web server or a local file system. If you're unfamiliar with using git to clone the repository, you can [download a zip file](https://github.com/adlnet/xapi-jqm/zipball/master) with the latest changes.

#### Configuration

The default credentials are setup to work with and account on the ADL LRS in the [config.js](js/config.js) file. You can edit this file to point to your own LRS and/or user.

**Example LRS credentials**

```js
Config.endpoint = "https://lrs.adlnet.gov/xapi/";
Config.user = "jqm";
Config.password = "xapijqm";
```

You can [register your own LRS user](http://lrs.adlnet.gov) on the ADL LRS.

**Local Storage Key Names**

Used to store values from the registration page.

```js
// Local Storage email names -- should / cloud be unique across apps
var storageKeyName = "xapi-jqm/name";
var storageKeyEmail = "xapi-jqm/email";
````

##### "Global Variables"

The [config.js](js/config.js) file also includes "global" variables, that are used in the building of statements. You can define variables you wish to use throughout your course with these.

**Example:**

```js
var moduleID = "http://adlnet.gov/xapi/samples/xapi-jqm/course/"; // trailing slash
var moduleName = "How to Make French Toast xapi-jqm Course Demo";
var courseType = "http://adlnet.gov/xapi/activities/course";
```

*note:* Change the moduleID, moduleName and courseType to something appropriate for your app.

##### Custom Verbs

The [verbs.js](js/verbs.js) file allows you to setup custom verbs.

**Example:**

```js
(function(ADL){
   ADL.custom = {
      "verbs": {
         "read" : {
            "id" : "http://example.com/xapi/verbs/read",
            "display" : {"en-US" : "read"}
         },
         "checked" : {
            "id" : "http://example.com/xapi/verbs/checked",
            "display" : {"en-US" : "checked"}
         },
         "unchecked" : {
            "id" : "http://example.com/xapi/verbs/unchecked",
            "display" : {"en-US" : "unchecked"}
         }           
      }   
   };
}(window.ADL = window.ADL || {}));
```

### Statements Built from Attributes in HTML

A [statement](https://github.com/adlnet/xAPI-Spec/blob/master/xAPI.md#statement) is built in JSON that gets sent to your LRS of choice.

#### The HTML Attributes Used to Build the Statements


The ```data-chapter``` attribute defines what chapter you're in:

```html
<body data-chapter="steps">
```

Pages in jQuery Mobile (jQM) are defined as divs with a ```data-role="page"```:

```html
<div data-role="page" id="p2">
  <h2>My Content</h2>
</div>
```

#### An Overview of a Statement

The statement below includes some helper functions from the [functions.js](js/functions.js) file as well as definitions in the [config.js](js/config.js). These functions will be covered in [another document not yet written]().

**VERBOSE STATEMENT**

```js
var stmt = {
    "actor": actor,
    "verb": ADL.verbs.experienced,
    "context": {
        "contextActivities": {
            "parent": [
                {
                    "id": moduleID,
                    "definition": {
                        "name": {
                            "en-US": "xAPI for jQuery Demo"
                        },
                        "description": {
                            "en-US": "A sample HTML5 mobile app with xAPI tracking."
                        }
                    },
                    "objectType": "Activity"
                }
            ]
        }
    },
    "object": {
        "id" : activityID,
        "objectType": "Activity",
        "definition": {
            "name": {
                "en-US": "xAPI jQuery Mobile " + chapter + " " + pagename
            }
        }
    }
};
```

**CONSOLIDATED**

```js
// statement for launching content
var stmt = {
    "actor": actor,
    "verb": ADL.verbs.completed,
    "context": createContext(),
    "object": {
        "id": moduleID + chapterCompleted,
        "objectType": "Activity",
        "definition": {
            "name": {
                "en-US": "How to Make French Toast Chapter: " + chapterCompleted
            }
        }
    }
};
```

The [config.js](js/config.js) also includes a *baseActivity* definition:

```js
var baseActivity = {
    "id": moduleID,
    "definition": {
        "name": {
            "en-US": moduleName
        },
        "description": {
            "en-US": "Great starting point with a blank slate. Read more about templates to learn how to integrate and track."
        }
    },
    "objectType": "Activity"
};
```

This can be used to consolidate even further, for example:

```js
function courseLaunched() {
    
    doConfig();

    // statement for launching content
    var stmt = {
        "actor": actor,
        "verb": ADL.verbs.launched,
        "object": baseActivity
    };

    // Send launched statement
    ADL.XAPIWrapper.sendStatement(stmt);

}
```

### The State API

The [State API](https://github.com/adlnet/xAPI-Spec/blob/master/xAPI.md#stateapi) stores state information on the LRS, such as the current chapter and page.

### Templates

This course is built with multiple examples of commonly used widgets. Below offers a brief overview of how they are used in xapi-jqm. For more detailed information please refer to [this document that doesn't exist yet]().

#### Table of Contents

Provide a list of steps that can be tracked for their completed progress through a "chapter"

#### Glossary

Layout a list of words and track which words a user has read

#### Checklist

Reports checked and unchecked

#### Video Tracking

Utilizes popcorn.js and xapipopcorn.js to track videos

*in progress*

#### Quiz

Quizes can be built from three types of inputs:

- Checklist (mulitple choice)
- Radio (single choice)
- Text Box (strict string comparison)

*in progress*

#### Modal (pop-up) Windows

A template for a trigger that opens a modal a.k.a. pop-up window.
